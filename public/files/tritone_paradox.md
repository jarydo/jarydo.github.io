Recreated Diana Deutch's famous [Tritone Paradox](https://deutsch.ucsd.edu/psychology/pages.php?i=206) by creating Shepard tones in Python and sending a mass survey study. TLDR; people born in the GTA hear music fundamentally different than people born in Vancouver.

Try to hear if [these pairs of tones](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AEg6KEJphVHV13A0WhnR09L0gmBYegjU/view?usp=drive_link) are ascending (going up in pitch) or descending (going down in pitch) and compare with a friend - the results may surprise you (especially if they grew up speaking a different dialect!)
