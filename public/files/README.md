Yo! I’m Jaryd, a creative technologist based in Toronto and a CS + HCI student at the University of Waterloo on the side. I'm passionate about community, film, music, and any combination of the 3. And yes I have a y in my name, it’s because my dad had a dream - don’t question it.

I love to bring whimsy and a little extra sparkle to everyday life! Currently exploring human-centred computing, art tech, and 3d graphics.

Some recent projects:

- Turned my transit card into a magic wand (#1 on r/Toronto)
- Took the most awkward parts of a birthday and made it a playable experience (featured on WebCurios, 94.5 The Buzz, Hubspot, and more)
- Created a localized newspaper for my 8 roommates
- Organized a sold-out student film festival at my favourite local theatre
- Mario Kart with the soundtrack played by a live band
- Friend-nominated dating algorithms
- Conceptualized and finished a short film in 6 weeks for buildspace
- Ran a summer camp for adults
- Built an RPG party game about organizing a hackathon (for a hackathon)

Hope you enjoy your stay - plenty of hidden goodies to find
