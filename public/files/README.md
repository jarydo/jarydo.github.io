Yo! I’m Jaryd, a CS student passionate about coding, film, music, and any combination of the 3 (and yes I have a y in my name, it’s because my dad had a dream - don’t question it). 

I strongly believe in the power of community - from student council all the way back in middle school to hosting Socratica sessions now, creating spaces and opportunities for people to connect face-to-face as human beings drives innovation, purpose, and happiness. 

Some recent projects:

* Created a short film in 6 weeks for buildspace
* Hosting a student film festival at my favourite local theatre
* Mario Kart with a live band accompaniment
* Friend-nominated dating algorithms
* Ran a summer camp for adults
* Built an RPG party game about organizing a hackathon (for a hackathon)

Hope you enjoy your stay - plenty of hidden goodies to find
