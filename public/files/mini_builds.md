Using WebSockets, React, and Next.js, created a real-time RPG party game about organizing a hackathon ([for a hackathon](https://x.com/jaryd_diamond/status/1846227535144620303)). Minigames include: getting people's attention for lunch (reach volume threshold on your mic), calling up a new caterer (collectively dial a phone number), and approving correct invoices (working together, ensure your receipts line up with purchases).
