I watch movies. [Often](https://letterboxd.com/jarydo/).

My (current) faves:

- Don Hertzfeldt's [It's Such a Beautiful Day](https://vimeo.com/ondemand/itssuchabeautifulday) changed the directory of my life. I have never had a piece of art affect me so profoundly before, and I am not sure I will again. Animation is so powerful. Managed to convince my local cinema to play it during the re-release, eternally grateful to have seen it in theatres.

- Terry Gilliam's [Brazil](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_7ATU9dslE&ab_channel=HDRetroTrailers) is a masterwork of set design and creativity, it operates on its own plane of existence and is so unabashedly itself. 

- Jonathan Demme's [Stop Making Sense](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rjMwSTeVeo&ab_channel=A24) I had to see multiple times in theatres during the re-run. Pure joy encapsulated, the only film I've ever seen that not only captures the concert experience but enhances it (and of one of the best bands to ever do it, Talking Heads).

- Richard Linklater's [Before Trilogy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QM6foz7YDdg&ab_channel=CRITERION) has the most authentic dialogue ever put to screen. Best trilogy ever.
