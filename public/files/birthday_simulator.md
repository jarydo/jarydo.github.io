It was my dad's birthday, but I was spending the summer in a different city, so I decided to make him the "most unique gift \[he's\] ever received" (his words, not mine). I thought back to what the most awkward parts of a birthday are - being the centre of attention, receiving texts from random people, a reminder of your own mortality - and made it into a simulator!
