For my UX design class, created a [functional prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/YlML2YDvnqOo3qsgdf6mZO/CS-449---borrowbee?node-id=585-2744&node-type=canvas&t=QRHnqanAWAsLzfYl-1&scaling=scale-down&content-scaling=fixed&page-id=585%3A1266&starting-point-node-id=585%3A1633&show-proto-sidebar=1) on Figma of an app to encourage local lending! We tackled UN SDG 11 - Sustainable Cities and Communities and designed a platform for users to borrow items from resource libraries nearby along with attending workshops to learn new skills using items in stock, helping solve the decline of local communities and resource sharing.

After multiple rounds of user interviews, paper prototyping, and design critiques, we [presented our project](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cx9sYUIOX_zgqXbXaJWRAIMWax8wghjY/view) in front of hundreds of other students and met with NPO and resource library KW Library of Things to discuss real-world viability. Development may soon be underway!
