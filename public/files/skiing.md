I've been skiing since I was very young and I can't get enough of it. In another life, I was a downhill ski racer and then a ski coach, teaching kids how to go fast (safely). Although in retrospect - teaching 14 8-year olds how to parallel ski is more babysitting on snow than anything else. An equally difficult task (especially on a busy hill)!

I've skied at Mont Tremblant and am going to Revelstoke, hope to ski in France and Japan one day!
