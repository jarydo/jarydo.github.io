I direct movies. [Sometimes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XxZZ2Gt2Y0&ab_channel=UWFilmClub).

Created a short film called Letterboxing (linked above) within 6 weeks on a $0 budget, flew out to San Francisco to present it in front of 1000 other makers as a part of buildspace s5. Definitely a fish-out-of-water experience, especially considering I had basically no experience directing and wasn't working on AI like most other projects. 

Briefly dabbled with directing in high school, ran a film festival there. Currently planning one for student filmmakers hosted at Princess Cinemas, my favourite theatre ever.
