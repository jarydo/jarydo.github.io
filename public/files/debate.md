Co-founded and ran the largest club in my high school's history, with over a quarter of the student body joining the online forum and over 100k posts made (more than the entire student body of New Zealand as per the Vice-President of Edsby). Ran multiple formal and informal tournaments, winning the best new club award for my efforts. Learned a lot about dealing with school bureaucracy, free speech and censorship, and effectively growing communities.
