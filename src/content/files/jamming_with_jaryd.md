I've played music (in some form) for most of my life. Started with piano, then tenor sax in high school, now guitar and music production. Can't get enough of the stuff.

In terms of listening, love me some alternative and indie rock, especially shoegaze. If prompted, I can talk about my favourite musicians and albums endlessly.

Here are some playlists I'm proud of:
